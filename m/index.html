          Thoughts Before Kenya
        </div>
        <div class="body">
          On the eve of a journey to the cradle of civilization, a plethora of emotions, thoughts, and hopes enthrall my mind. Kenya, though so far and seemingly unrelated to myself and my existence in the north of North America, strangely feels like it will be a homecoming. I have experienced this feeling when I return to the tiny island in the Caribbean where the sun is hot, the people are friendly, and the mood is genuinely laid back. Mama Africa is home. Not just for those of darker complexions, but for all. I read an article at some point where the author was imploring young people to travel. The thesis being that you have not truly lived if you have not travelled and experienced cultures that provide a sharp contrast to your own. The idea that you will have time to travel when you are older is flawed in that it is dependent on the assumption that opportunity is patient and waits for the individual. Nothing is promised; life has a way of just happening and opportunities are lost faster than they are found. For that reason one should use every opportunity they have to take on new experiences and live a little bit more. Inspired by a friendâ€™s adventure, I have found a volunteer trip with Habitat for Humanity to Kenya to be the source of that little more life in my young existence. Whether I return wiser, worldlier, more experienced, and more compassionate, what is certain is that I will not return unchanged.
